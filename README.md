# ezSFML
Personal Library used in my project to create usefull GUI object based on SFML library
It lack a lot of coding style and need much more documentation.
It also has some features (bugs) that could be improved.

If you want to use it and you see a problem, please report it

If you're from Epitech, don't even think about it...
